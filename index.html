          <div>

            <p>After I graduated from San Diego State University, I went straight into public accounting and became a
              CPA.
              I
              spent countless hours creating spreadsheets and enjoyed writing formulas in excel. One day a colleague of
              mine
              who is a Software Engineer saw all the IF statements and functions I was creating and jokingly said "You
              should just become a coder".</p>
            <p>After 7 years in the finance industry it was time for me to finally consider his words. With technology
              all
              around us it was a no-brainer and I finally decided to learned how to code. Now a student at Thinkful, I
              hope
              to gain practical experience and skills to become a pro developer.</p>
